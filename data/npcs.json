      "description": "An Arkan with luminous deep blue eyes and chitinous silver-white skin. Slender and graceful, Lady Selara’s warmth and empathy stand in place of martial prowess. She is betrothed to Marik Veltaris-Falkrest, offering her heartfelt support from the sidelines rather than on the battlefield. As a devoted follower of Serenya and Seraphis, her healing talents extend beyond traditional magic—she has pioneered a new method of blending Ryanite with living tissue to create bio-enhanced prosthetics.",
